# GitLab Migration Guide

This guide outlines the process for migrating data from an old GitLab instance to a new GitLab instance. It covers the migration of projects, users, and groups to ensure a seamless transition.

## Overview

The migration involves several steps, including cloning existing GitLab projects, creating new repositories in the target GitLab instance, migrating users and their group memberships, and finally, pushing the cloned projects to the new GitLab instance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or newer
- Access to both the old and new GitLab instances
- Administrative access to both GitLab instances
- The `requests` Python library for API requests

## Setup

1. Ensure Python and pip are installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

3. Configure the `gitLab_API.py` script with your old and new GitLab API endpoints and private tokens.

    ```python
    source_gitlab_api = "http://old-gitlab/api/v4/"
    target_gitlab_api = "http://new-gitlab/api/v4/"
    source_headers = {"PRIVATE-TOKEN": "<old_gitlab_private_token>"}
    target_headers = {"PRIVATE-TOKEN": "<new_gitlab_private_token>"}
    ```

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Clone All GitLab Projects

Use the `cloneAllGitProgects.py` script to clone all projects from the old GitLab instance. Specify the target directory for the cloned repositories.

### Step 2: Create New Repositories

Run the `create_new_repo.py` script to create corresponding new repositories in the target GitLab instance based on the cloned projects.

### Step 3: Migrate Users

Execute the `migate_users_to_groups.py` script to migrate users from the old GitLab instance to the new one, preserving their group memberships.

### Step 4: Remove Specific User from All Groups (Optional)

If needed, the `remov_one_user_from_all_groups.py` script can be used to remove a specific user from all groups in the target GitLab instance.

### Step 5: Migrate All Users and Groups

The `passAllUsersAndGroupsToNewGitlab.py` script further assists in migrating all users and their group memberships to the new GitLab instance.

### Step 6: Push All Projects to the New GitLab

Finally, use the `pushAllGitProgects.py` script to push all cloned projects to their respective new repositories in the target GitLab instance.

## Additional Information

- Ensure that you have sufficient permissions in both GitLab instances to perform the migration.
- It's recommended to test the migration process with a small set of data before applying it to the entire dataset.

## Support

For any issues or questions related to this migration process, refer to the official GitLab documentation or contact your GitLab administrator.
